This is the Spomenik interactive audioguide system.


Installation and setup instructions
===
1) Create a MySQL database for the system, e.g., using PHPMyAdmin or similar
tool. For the purposes of these instructions this database name is `spomenik'.

2) To configure you will need to edit two files: src/header.php and 
src/header_shared.php. For src/header.php, change the MySQL details as per what
was set up in (2), and create a file somewhere that holds the MySQL password (do
not put this in your web path):

class MySQL
{
    const USER = "root";
    const HOST = "localhost";
    const DBNAME = "spomenik";
    const PASSWD_FILE = "/home/foo/mysql-passwd.txt";
}

For src/header_shared.php there are a bunch of URLs to set that point to your
installation path, and a few file paths:

class Sys
{
	const AUDIO_BASE_URL = 
		"http://server.org/spomenik/audio/";
	...
	
	const TROPO_KEY_FILE = "/home/foo/tropo_key.txt";
	const UPLOAD_DIR = "/var/www/spomenik/uploads/";
	const AUDIO_DIR = "/var/www/spomenik/audio/";
}

3) Modify install.sh to point to the installation directory, e.g.,

	PATH=/var/www/spomenik/

In these instructions we have assumed that this is the URL

	http://server.org/spomenik/

Run the install.sh script to copy the files to PATH.

4) Create a new Application with your Tropo account. Set the URL for both voice
calls and messaging to point to the URL where main.php now resides, e.g., 

	http://server.org/spomenik/main.php

Copy the Outbound Token for Messaging by clicking the link further down the page
for the Application (this will look like the following

	Your Token:
		03aadf4e835c...
). Paste the token into the file we set as the key, e.g., 

	/home/foo/tropo_key.txt

Obviously you will need to add a new phone number for the Tropo Application, as
well as switch to production mode when you are ready.
